# pdf_into_single_files

Using the `pdftools` package to split large pdfs into individual pages. 

Needs: 
 - pdftools
 - tidyverse (or stringr and purrr if you want indv. files)
 
Optional: 
  - here (which builds relative file paths to your R project so you don't need to use `setwd()`)
  
R script is in the R folder. 

Feel free to modify the paths as you need. I only used a subset of 100 pages for this.
